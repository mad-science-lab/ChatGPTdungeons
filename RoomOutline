Here's a dungeon for level 2 characters with seven rooms, each containing different challenges:

Room 1:
- Description: As the adventurers enter the dungeon, they find themselves in a narrow corridor with flickering torches on the walls. The air feels damp and musty.
- Challenge: Two hungry dire rats guard the entrance. They attack the party as soon as they spot them.

Room 2:
- Description: The corridor opens up into a large chamber with a high ceiling. The room is filled with waist-high water, and a narrow stone path winds through it.
- Challenge: The water is home to a pair of menacing aquatic spiders. They attack from beneath the water, attempting to drag the characters under.

Room 3:
- Description: The adventurers come across a room with a polished marble floor. A large, ornate pedestal stands in the center.
- Challenge: The pedestal is trapped with a pressure plate. Stepping on it triggers a dart trap from the walls, shooting poisonous darts at anyone nearby.

Room 4:
- Description: The next room is shrouded in darkness, with a pungent smell hanging in the air.
- Challenge: A swarm of bloodthirsty bats resides in the room. The darkness makes it difficult for the characters to target the bats accurately.

Room 5:
- Description: The adventurers reach a room with a towering stone statue of a fearsome warrior. The statue holds a massive stone hammer.
- Challenge: When the characters approach the statue, it comes to life, animated by magic. The animated statue attacks the party with its stone hammer.

Room 6:
- Description: A narrow corridor leads to a small room with a rickety wooden bridge crossing a deep chasm.
- Challenge: The bridge is trapped, and some of its planks are loose. If the characters aren't careful, they might fall into the chasm below.

Room 7:
- Description: The final room is a treasure chamber, filled with glittering jewels, golden statues, and piles of coins.
- Challenge: Guarding the treasure is a fearsome minotaur. It charges at the adventurers as soon as they enter, using its brute strength and powerful horns.

Remember to adjust the difficulty and number of monsters based on the size of your party and their capabilities. Good luck and have fun with your adventure!
